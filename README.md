Going back to school on the GI Bill to earn an AAS in Computer Science to work my way toward a software design job.

## Programming Knowledge
The programming languages I am familiar with are:
- * HTML
- * CSS
- JavaScript
- ** Python
- ** Assembly

* not really a "programming language"
** limited experience, learned years ago and forgot almost everything I was taught

I have been programming of and on for 20 years.
